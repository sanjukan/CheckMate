Software Design Group Project 
**Project Name: CheckMate **
In today's digital age, software engineering plays a crucial role in our lives. There is a software aspect in almost everything we use and do. Increasing the need for software engineers and companies. However, software teams often struggle with scattered tasks, poor communication, and disorganized workflows, which can slow down projects and miss opportunities for teamwork. Our "CheckMate" app is here to solve these problems. It's a one-stop solution for creating, organizing, and discussing tasks, ensuring everyone's on the same page. With real-time chat and code integration, it's not just a task manager; it's a game-changer for software teams, making work smoother and more efficient. Without the assets that our app provides compared to other software, there is much less organization and control over all your work. It is necessary to have realtime chat and code integration to improve communication so that when team members are working, there is much less overlapping work and unorganized ideas.
